# About the Bridging Mental Health Network
The Bridging Mental Health Network is a recently founded initiative aiming to promote interdisciplinary exchange of mental health research undertaken at the University of Cambridge and advance foundational debates about mental health. We connect researchers from disciplines such as psychiatry, psychology, social and evolutionary anthropology, literary studies, evolutionary psychiatry, sociology, history and philosophy of science, education and public health.    

Each term, we host two events where researchers from different disciplines share their perspectives on mental health in a 30-minute talk. This is followed by a 30-minute Q&A with an audience drawn from diverse academic backgrounds. The conversation is continued more informally at a local pub.
