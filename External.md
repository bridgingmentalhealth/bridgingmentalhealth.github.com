Hosted at St John’s College, University of Cambridge, the series brings together leading researchers, clinicians, charity representatives, and individuals with lived experience to foster informed discussion, challenge misconceptions, and highlight emerging research and treatment avenues. 
Across six events in 2026, the series will cover topics including the neurobiology of OCD, body dysmorphic disorder, perinatal OCD, hoarding, trauma-related OCD, and new therapeutic approaches. Each lecture combines expert talks with panel discussions and audience Q&A, aiming to bridge research, clinical practice, and real-world experience.
